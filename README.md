# sqlalchemy_challenge

This is the repository that holds my Module 10 SQLalchemy-challenge.

Module Overview: The challenge was divided into 2 parts: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data and Design Your Climate App.

•Part 1. Analyze and Explore the Climate Data: We were asked to do a climate analysis about the area in Honolulu, Hawaii by using Python and SQLAlchemy. Specifically, we used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

•Part 2. Design Your Climate App: We were asked to design a FLASK API based on the queries developed in part 1. API routes were created for the home page, precipitation, stations, tobs, start date, start date to end-date.


The “SurfsUp” folder contains the following:

•“Precipitation Analysis png”: Visualization of the precipitation analysis for part 1.

•“Temperature Analysis png”: Visualization of the temperature analysis for part 1.

•“app.py”: My FLASK API code for part 2.

•“Climate_starter.ipynb”: MY sql_alchemy code for part 1 of the challenge.

•“Resources” subfolder which holds these files:

1. 2 csv files used for this challenge.

2. “Hawaii.sqlite” file
